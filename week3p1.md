# üèóÔ∏è Scalable Web Application Architecture ‚Äî Traditional vs. Serverless

## üìå Project Overview
This project demonstrates two approaches to building a **scalable web application** (IslandCart, an e-commerce platform):

1. **Traditional Server Scaling**
   - Uses load balancers, EC2 Auto Scaling Groups, RDS, ElastiCache, S3, and SQS + workers.
   - Vertical scaling at the database layer.
   - Horizontal scaling at the web/application tiers.

2. **Serverless Architecture**
   - Uses CloudFront, S3, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, Cognito, and EventBridge.
   - Fully managed services with automatic scaling.
   - Pay-per-request cost model.

The goal is to compare the two designs in terms of **performance, cost, scaling, operational overhead, and use cases.**

## üñºÔ∏è Architecture Diagrams
- **Traditional Design**
  - Route 53 ‚Üí WAF ‚Üí CloudFront ‚Üí ALB ‚Üí EC2 Web ASG ‚Üí EC2 App ASG ‚Üí {RDS, ElastiCache, S3, SQS ‚Üí Worker ASG}
  - Private subnets for compute/data, public for ALB/NAT.
  - Externalized sessions (Redis), async jobs via SQS.

- **Serverless Design**
  - Route 53 ‚Üí WAF ‚Üí CloudFront (origins: S3 static, API Gateway)
  - API Gateway (JWT authorizer via Cognito) ‚Üí Lambda ‚Üí {DynamoDB, S3 (pre-signed), EventBridge ‚Üí Lambda/StepFn}
  - Fully managed, automatically scaled services.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Scaling Strategies

### Traditional
- **Vertical Scaling (DB):**
  - RDS instance class upgrades (e.g., r7g.large ‚Üí r7g.8xlarge).
  - Add read replicas to offload heavy reads.
  - Use RDS Proxy for connection pooling.
- **Horizontal Scaling (Web/App/Workers):**
  - Auto Scaling Groups tied to ALB metrics (latency, CPU).
  - Redis for sessions/caches to keep servers stateless.
  - Workers scale on SQS backlog.

### Serverless
- **Lambda Scaling:**
  - Automatic per-request; use Provisioned Concurrency for critical paths.
- **DynamoDB Scaling:**
  - On-Demand or Autoscaling for RCU/WCU.
- **API Gateway & CloudFront:**
  - Scale automatically with traffic.
- **Event-driven:**
  - EventBridge + Lambda/Step Functions handle async workloads.

## üìä Comparison & Analysis

### Performance
- **Traditional:** Predictable latency, ASG lag during spikes.
- **Serverless:** Near-instant scaling, occasional cold starts.

### Cost
- **Traditional:** Fixed baseline (EC2, RDS, Redis, NAT). Good for steady load with Savings Plans.
- **Serverless:** Pay-per-use. Excellent for spiky/variable workloads.

### Operations
- **Traditional:** Requires patching, scaling policies, DB tuning.
- **Serverless:** No servers to manage; focus on IAM, limits, and monitoring.

### Development & Deployment
- **Traditional:** Full-stack servers, AMI/container deploys, blue-green/rolling.
- **Serverless:** Function-per-feature, CDK/SAM pipelines, smaller blast radius.

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Traditional best for:**
  - Constant, predictable traffic.
  - Complex SQL workloads (transactions, joins).
  - Environments with strong DevOps/SRE teams.
  - Compliance requiring server-level controls.

- **Serverless best for:**
  - Spiky or unpredictable traffic.
  - Event/HTTP-driven apps.
  - Lean teams that want to minimize ops.
  - Rapid iteration and global reach.

## üìÇ Deliverables
- **Diagrams:** Traditional & Serverless architectures with all components and flows.
- **Design Document:** Detailed explanation of components, scaling strategies, decisions, and security considerations.
- **Comparison (Part 3):** Scalability, cost, operational complexity, workflows, and use cases.
- **README.md (this file):** Summary for quick reference.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
- **Traditional scaling** gives control, predictability, and fits steady traffic + SQL-heavy apps.  
- **Serverless** provides agility, low idle cost, and elastic scaling for bursty or fast-evolving workloads.  
- The right choice depends on traffic patterns, team expertise, compliance needs, and long-term scalability goals.
